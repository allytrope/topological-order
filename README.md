# topological-order

Graphs are defined using a vector of vertex names and an adjacency list.
These are to be manually inserted into the main function under the appropriate variables.
Two topological orderings will be printed to the console for each graph given, one using depth-first search and the other using breadth-first search.
If no order exists (i.e., the graph has a cycle), the program will print out such.
